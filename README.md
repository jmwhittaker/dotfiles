# Dotfiles

My own personal OS X dotfiles.

This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles and is here as a backup for me. Most of what you see here has been found by browsing other peoples dotfiles on Github and then adjusting them to my personal taste.

They should be cloned into your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles`.

There is an install script which **will** blat your dotfiles so if you do run this then please make a backup!

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:jmwhittaker/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles

    sh dotfiles.sh
